# HW-5 Submission

HW5 Submission for Emmett Osborne

## Overview
Finally completed HW5. 

Quickly put together the SM. Seems to work? haha. I think it's strange we needed it to work even if both nickel and dime assert simultaniously but hey I got it working \o/

Note: I ran the sim over the needed time, which is why the break on line 72 triggered.
