# HW-3 Submission

HW3 Submission for Emmett Osborne

## Overview
Finally completed HW3. Had nurmerous issues getting Questa running. Had licensing issues since I had installed Questa over a year ago. Conflicting licenses somehow corrupted my Quartus project in the process. I had technically completed the VHDL by the due date, just had not got Questa to simulate it. I committed my work to my hw-3 branch. Later, while still working through Questa issues I realized the corruption and I had to revert back to my build before my hw-3 branch. I deleted the branch and recreated it this evening when I finally realized my issue.

I had intended to come to your work session on the 9th but I had a conflicting doctor's appointment. I also have a doctor's appointment on Friday, so I won't be able to attend class then either.

### Questions 
None! Other than why on earth is getting a Questa license so difficult? That took waaaaay too long. It took 48 hours alone to get the confirmation email :/
