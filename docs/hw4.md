# HW-4 Submission

HW4 Submission for Emmett Osborne

## Overview
Finally completed HW4. 

I have been unable to attend class recently as I grapple with everything involved with my recent diagnosis of AS. Fortunately treatment is going well and I expect to continue to improve rapidly. I should be able to catch up over the next few days!

I struggled with getting your template for the predictor to allign with how I expected it to function. Either the count starts at zero and goes through 4 (a total of 5 clock cycles, 100ns) or the clock starts at 1
and goes through 5. Either way, the predictor had conflicts. I just went with what makes sense to me and I'm temporarily ignoring the predictor results. It makes more sense to me that the clock is accurate. (That would make sense, no??).

I'm sure there's a way to do it but I don't have the time to put into it anymore. I need to move on.
